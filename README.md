# Customer-Segmentation-for-Marketing-Strategies

Customer segmentation is a pivotal strategy in modern marketing, enabling businesses to deliver more personalized services and efficiently allocate marketing resources. In this project, we leverage a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle to delve into the shopping behaviors and preferences of consumers. Through meticulous analysis, our goal is to identify distinct clusters within the customer base. These segments will help tailor marketing approaches to better meet the specific needs and expectations of different customer groups, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes in marketing campaigns.
